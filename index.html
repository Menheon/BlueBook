        <h1>Kasper Dueholm Borg</h1>

        <h4>About Me 🤔</h4>
        <p>Hi I'm Kasper, I'm a 22 year old human. Before Web Development my education was an AP degree in Computer
            Science,
            which I also studied at the academy.</p>
        <h4>Background 🌲</h4>
        <p>My Current background on my laptop and desktop is this cute picture:</p>
        <img src="forest.jpg" width="384" height="216">
        <p>Before I had the standard Windows background (it doesn't change that often).</p>

        <h4>Location 🌍</h4>
        <p>I live in Viby about 2,5 km from the academy.</p>

        <h4>Family 👨‍👩‍👦</h4>
        <p>I have two siblings; an older brother and an older sister. I also have about 13 cousins.</p>

        <h4>New Capability 💪🏻</h4>
        <p>Since a year ago, I've been introduced to Python and C#. </p>

        <h4>If I got a gift certificate 💵</h4>
        <p>If I had been given a certificate for 5.000 kr. I would maybe buy a new headset, which should be wireless. If
            not
            that, I might look into getting a new tattoo, if the country wasn't in lock down.</p>

        <h4>My definition of wealth 💸</h4>
        <p>I'd call you wealthy if you have enough money to spend some on your hobbies and not just essentials like food
            and
            shelter - all the basics needs.</p>
